## Shakespeare Doth Mic Drop ðŸŽ¤

For my take home assessment, I used the following:

1.  Create React App as the base
2.  Styled Components for CSS
3.  Axios for API requests
4.  React Reveal for great animations
5.  A little bit of Photoshop to adjust a free to use image of Shakespeare so that I could use it on any colored background and not just white.

### Testing ðŸš€

This was my first attempt at doing testing (my current job doesn't allow for this yet). I found a few resources to help me learn some basics and I was able to produce the following:

1. Create a mocked Axios function
2. Await the response and gather the data
3. Make a few assertions, like what the returned data should look like, how many times the request should have been made, and what options the call should have been made with.

You can see this in the `__tests__` and `__mocks__` folders and by running `yarn test`.

### You know what to do ðŸ˜„

Run the app `yarn start`
